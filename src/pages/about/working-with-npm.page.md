# Working with NPM

[NPM (Node Package Manager)](https://docs.npmjs.com/) is the world's largest software registry, consisting of the registry itself and the tools to interact with NPM and to use nearly any JS or front end package known to mankind. NPM was built for use with [NodeJS](nodejs.org/) but has expanded to include the entire JavaScript ecosystem. **If you are not yet familiar with NPM, [get familiar](https://docs.npmjs.com/)**; _you won't regret it!

_It is super easy to get started with NPM._ After [getting set up](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node), all you need to know is:

- How to [install NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).
- How to [install NPM packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally).
- How to work with [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json).

The rest will come naturally over time. They have [great documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/) to help you be a pro.
