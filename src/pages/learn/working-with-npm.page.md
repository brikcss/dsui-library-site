# Working with NPM

## What is NPM?

[Node Package Manager (<abbr title="Node Package Manager">NPM</abbr>)](https://docs.npmjs.com/) is the world's largest software registry. NPM was originally created for [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), but has since expanded to include the entire JavaScript ecosystem, as well as nearly any front end package known to mankind. It is considered the de facto standard for front end packages, as well for all types of Node packages.

NPM consists of the software registry itself, but also a valuable set of tools. With NPM you can:

- Adapt packages of code to your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.
- Download standalone tools you can use right away.
- Run packages without downloading using [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx).
- Easily manage multiple versions of code and code dependencies.
- Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.
- Discover multiple ways to solve the same puzzle.
- Create and manage organizations and virtual teams to coordinate package maintenance, coding, and developers.
- Run packages from the command line with "[NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts)" (see below).
- Run custom scripts with [NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) (see below).

## Getting Started with NPM

_It is very easy to get started with NPM:_

- [Get set up](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).
- Learn how to [install NPM packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally).
- Learn how to work with [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json).
- Learn how to use [NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) (see below).

The rest will come naturally over time. They have [great documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/) to help you become a pro.

### NPM Scripts

NPM Scripts is a very powerful (and underrated) feature of NPM. In the words of one user:

> "NPM scripts are among my favorite features of NPM. They are simple. They reduce the need for tools. Hence they reduce the number of configuration files and other things you need to keep track of. And they are very versatile."
>
> "NPM scripts are, well, scripts [which we] use... to automate repetitive tasks. For example, building your project, minifying Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript (JS) files. Scripts are also used in deleting temporary files and folders, etc,. There are many ways to pull this off — you could write bash/batch scripts, or use a task runner like Gulp or Grunt. However, a lot of people are moving over to NPM scripts for their simplicity and versatility."

_The possibilities of things you can do with NPM Scripts is endless._ However, one big downfall is that NPM itself does not provide great documentation about its wide variety of uses or how powerful it can be. Thankfully, due to its popularity, there is no shortage of information and tutorials from its users.
